Spot the Fake &mdash; Tinder Edition

Identify fake news based on their content and source

You will be given 10 news articles. Your job is to identify whether they contain real or fake news. If an
article contains real news, swipe right; if not, swipe left (please use the swipe right/left buttons, and don't
actually try to swipe on a touchscreen device). If the article contains some half-truths, employs fallacious
reasoning or uses evidence that is factual but taken out of context, you should still swipe left. We cannot
guarantee a Tinder date, but we can guarantee something undoubtedly better: improvements in your ability to
identify fake news upon completing this quiz with an excellent score.
<br />
<br />
There may be some twists in the articles, so you should remain observant and should consider every aspect of the
article, including the content, author, publisher, visual aids and UI. Oh, and while we are still on the topic
of Tinder, you shouldn't cheat on this quiz in the same way you (probably?) shouldn't cheat on your SO.

The Grand Knowledge Test &mdash; SAT Edition

Put your knowledge of detecting fake news to the test

Just like a CollegeBoard SAT subject test, this quiz contains MC questions, each with 4 options, with 1 point
rewarded for each correct answer, 1/3 point subtracted for each incorrect answer and 0 point for unanswered
questions; the points are subsequently scaled such that the maximum mark for this quiz is 800. However, unlike
the SAT, there's no need to hit up on a $200 textbook and a $2000 tutor, and to memorize a ton of seemingly
random facts that you could have easily looked up on Google &#128586;.

Fact Check Detective Training &mdash; COVID-19 Edition

Fight against COVID-19 misinformation

While scientists are busy discovering a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, you should be busy fighting against the
misinformation on COVID-19. This quiz consists of 10 questions, each with 3 accompanying pieces of text. Your
job is to eradicate the "fake news virus" (fake-news-CoV-16) by clicking on the pieces that contain fake news
regarding COVID-19. It's too bad that the coronavirus cannot be eradicated with the press of a button*, but at
least this quiz should keep you busy during home quarantine.

*However, you can help stop its spread by following public health guidelines &#128521;.
