# Factibly

## Local Setup

Note: The following information is only applicable for local setups so that you can test our apps on a development environment. You can continue to use our production-ready apps; their URLs have been tabulated in the [Apps and Services](#apps-and-services) section.

The setup instructions for each of our apps are available in their respective READMEs. You can _either_ follow those instructions (recommended) _or_ run our custom bash [script](./fc-internal/setup.sh). For more information on the latter option, you should read the [README](https://github.com/Sapphire-Labs/Hackathon/blob/master/fc-internal/README.md) for the fc-internal subproject.

The [fc-api](./fc-api/) subproject contains the back-end code for **all** our applications. You _must_ set that up.

**Regardless of which setup method you employ, you'll need to configure the environment variables in order to run our apps locally.** You can issue a request for these variables via an email to Jadon at [jdsare@gmail.com](mailto:jdsare@gmail.com).
